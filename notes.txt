What is BackTracking?
Branching - Generate all possibilities and then check each of them for a solution.
BackTracking - It is an optimize way to determine the path to solve a solution and discard those path which is not part of the solution.

Note: BackTracking Problem given n <=15

Backtracking problems are always implement by using recursion.

e.g 
Syntax for BackTracking
void backTracking(){
    if(termination case){
        increment or add the result to the answer
        return 
    }
    for(iteration on input){
        some logic on current value
        backTracking(current value)
        undo the current value 
    }
}
